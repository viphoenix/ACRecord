/**
 *  If you are a fan of Harry Potter, you would know the world of magic has its own currency system -- as Hagrid explained it to Harry, "Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it's easy enough." Your job is to write a program to compute A+B where A and B are given in the standard form of "Galleon.Sickle.Knut" (Galleon is an integer in [0, 107], Sickle is an integer in [0, 17), and Knut is an integer in [0, 29)).
 
     Input Specification:
     
     Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line with A and B in the standard form, separated by one space.
     
     Output Specification:
     
     For each test case you should output the sum of A and B in one line, with the same format as the input.
     
     Sample Input:
     3.2.1 10.16.27
     Sample Output:
     14.1.28
